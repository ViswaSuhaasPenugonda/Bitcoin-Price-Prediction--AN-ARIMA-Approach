# Bitcoin Price Prediction: AN ARIMA Approach
 
The use of digital currencies, especially Bitcoin, has increased significantly in recent years. However, the volatile nature of Bitcoin’s price has created a need for a prediction method that can help users make informed decisions about investing in Bitcoin. 

This project aims to develop a predictive method for Bit- coin prices by recognizing patterns in its time se- ries data. To achieve this, data was collected from Bitstamp from January 1, 2012, to March 31, 2021. The data underwent a preprocessing stage that in- cluded removing attributes, conducting a station- ary test, and differencing. 

The model candidates were then determined using the correlogram method. Two prediction methods were used, namely Autore- gressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), both of which have proven to be effective in short-term predictions. The results of the study in- dicated that the ARIMA (1,1,0) model and SARIMA (1,0,0,1) model produced predictions with the small- est Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score, indicating high accuracy. 

Therefore, these models are feasible for predicting Bitcoin prices in the short term. This project provides a promising approach for predicting Bitcoin prices, which can be useful for investors and traders in making informed deci- sions. However, it is important to note that Bitcoin’s volatile nature makes long-term predictions challeng- ing, and therefore, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution.
